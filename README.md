# Awesome "Aha!"

Some times you don't know where to start. Sometimes you just dont "get" it.
We're flooded with information and resources, but we, the more experienced lot,
all know which ones really made it sink for us.

This is a list of the best starting points that helped experienced
people learn new things quickly, and those pivotal resources that made an "Aha!" moment.


**NOTE: as such, this list is very carefully groomed, not all suggestions will be accepted,
but we'll do our best**


_Guidelines for submitting a topic:_

* It should be critically acclaimed.
* Prefer the original, timeless, resource over a derivative of it (such as a blog post).
* Prefer a derivative (such as an article, blog post, book) of the original when it really
is known to explain the subject in a better way.
* Any form of a resources is good: Books, videos, courses, talks, and more.
* When in doubt, just submit a PR and we'll help find the best way to make it into the list.

_Legend_:

* :pushpin: - timeless

Many thanks to everyone on the contributor list :)

## Unix

* :pushpin: [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) - "get" open source.

## Programming

_Pure programming, problem solving, detached of specific technology_

* :book: :pushpin: [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880) - programming and problem solving.
* :book: :pushpin: :mortar_board: [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) - Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs. For some, hard read. However, pivotal for understanding
  abstraction and Scheme makes the perfect beginner FP language. If you have
  time, invest it. Otherwise, try finding gists of the ideas in this book such
  as [here](www.sicpdistilled.com).




## Data

- :pineapple: :coffee: [Log structured merge trees](http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/) - the data structure that powers
a lot of recent big data products.
