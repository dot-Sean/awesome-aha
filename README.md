# Awesome "Aha!"

Some times you don't know where to start. Sometimes you just dont "get" it.
We're flooded with information and resources, but we, the more experienced lot,
all know which ones really made it sink for us.

This is a list of the best starting points that helped experienced
people learn new things quickly, and those pivotal resources that made an "Aha!" moment.


**NOTE: as such, this list is very carefully groomed, not all suggestions will be accepted,
but we'll do our best**


_Guidelines for submitting a topic:_

* It should be critically acclaimed.
* Prefer the original, timeless, resource over a derivative of it (such as a blog post).
* Prefer a derivative (such as an article, blog post, book) of the original when it really
is known to explain the subject in a better way.
* Any form of a resources is good: Books, videos, courses, talks, and more.
* When in doubt, just submit a PR and we'll help find the best way to make it into the list.

_Legend_:

* :pushpin: - timeless
* :book: - book
* :coffee: - accessible, coffee time reading
* :mortar_board: - academic / hard read
* :pineapple: - fresh, recent development
* :wrench: - makes you a pragmatic programmer



Many thanks to everyone on the contributor list :)



## Operating Systems
- :pushpin: [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) - probably the most accessible book about operating systems. Don't have to read this cover to cover, just hunt out interesting bits you like.

## Unix

* :pushpin: [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) - "get" open source.




## General Programming

_Pure programming, problem solving, detached of specific technology_

* :book: :pushpin: [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880) - programming and problem solving.
* :book: :pushpin: :mortar_board: [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) - Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs. For some, hard read. However, pivotal for understanding
  abstraction and Scheme makes the perfect beginner FP language. If you have
  time, invest it. Otherwise, try finding gists of the ideas in this book such
  as [here](www.sicpdistilled.com).
* :book: :wrench: :pushpin: [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) - a classic on a pragmatic thinking for programmers. Was a pivotal part
of driving a new era of thinking, tools, languages and platforms.



## Functional Programming

_Functional, and functional-style programming_

* :book: :pineapple: [Mostly Adequate Guide (to functional programming)](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide) - a great tutorial if you want to short-circuit years of wax-on wax-off to properly
"get" FP. Start with this if you don't have FP background, or have some university clue, and progress to more heavy hitters such as Haskell, Lisp and so on.
* :coffee: :pineapple: [FP Jargon](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon) and [The Perfect API](https://james-forbes.com/?/posts/the-perfect-api) - pair the "Mostly Adequate Guide" with these, either while reading, or after finishing reading it, to bolt in 
place all of the FP magic. These will also serve as a good cheatsheet for later.



## Patterns

* :pushpin: :mortar_board: [MVC](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/1979/mvc-1/1979-05-MVC.pdf), [MVP](http://www.wildcrest.com/Potel/Portfolio/mvp.pdf) - the original articles. MV-[wildcard] patterns will keep popping up,
but you must understand their original context, and see that it was so different than what they are used for today.




## Data

- :pineapple: :coffee: [Log structured merge trees](http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/) - the data structure that powers
a lot of recent big data products.




## Programming Languages

### Go

- [Golang Notes](https://github.com/luciotato/golang-notes) - coverage of several subjects from a programmer's perspective, including a bit of internals.




## Effectiveness

- :coffee: [How to read a book in a week](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week) - this is good for some nonfiction books, but all academic papers.



## Frameworks

### React

- :coffee: :pineapple: [React implementation
  notes](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/implementation-notes.html)
  and the [guiding
  principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html). They are simple to understand and
  well crafted. Read these even if you don't know what React is. If you're
  still not convinced, read [their implementation
  principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html#implementation), it felt like my 20 years of experience trying to build perfect APIs distilled into a small number of simple ideas.



## Mechanics

### Vim

- :pushpin: :coffee: [Seven habits of effective text editing](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html)
